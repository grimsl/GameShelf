# Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

1. **AWS CLI**: Install and configure AWS CLI
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

2. **Amplify CLI**: Install the Amplify CLI
   ```bash
   npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
   ```

## Development Setup

1. **Start the Amplify sandbox** (for development):
   ```bash
   npm run amplify:dev
   ```
   This will:
   - Deploy your backend resources to a temporary sandbox
   - Generate environment variables
   - Start the development server

2. **Access your app**: The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Production Deployment

1. **Deploy to production**:
   ```bash
   npm run amplify:deploy
   ```

2. **Build the frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Deploy the built files** to your hosting provider of choice.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are automatically generated by Amplify:

- `VITE_APP_AMPLIFY_DATA_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT`
- `VITE_APP_AWS_REGION`
- `VITE_APP_AWS_USER_POOL_ID`
- `VITE_APP_AWS_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID`
- `VITE_APP_AWS_IDENTITY_POOL_ID`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication not working**: Ensure your AWS Cognito user pool is properly configured
2. **GraphQL errors**: Check that your data models are correctly defined in `amplify/data/resource.ts`
3. **Build failures**: Make sure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
